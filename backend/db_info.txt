(5)\n```\n\n\n## (Commentary)\n\n**His, the Exalted, saying:** بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم (In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful). People sometimes perform an action or begin an undertaking and associate it with the name of a dear one among their dear ones, or a great one among their great ones, so that their action may be blessed (مباركاً) thereby and honored, or so that it may be a remembrance (ذكرى) by which they recall them. A similar practice also exists in the realm of naming (التسمية). They sometimes name a newborn human, or something they have made or done, such as a house they built or an institution they founded, after someone they love or venerate, so that the name remains through the persistence of the new namesake (المسمى الجديد), and the first namesake retains a kind of persistence through the persistence of the name, like someone who names his child after his father so that his memory (ذكره) is thereby kept alive, neither vanishing nor being forgotten.\n\nThe speech of the Exalted has followed this course, so He began the speech with His name, exalted is His Name (عز إسمه); so that the meaning it contains may be marked by His Name and connected to it, and so that it may be an etiquette (أدباً) by which He disciplines His servants in their deeds, actions, and sayings. Thus, they begin with His Name and act by it, and what they do is marked by His Name, described by His description (نعته), and intended for His sake, the Glorified. Thus, the deed will not be perished, vain, or cut off (مبتراً), because it is in the Name of Allah, to Whom destruction and vanity have no path.\n\nThis is because Allah, the Glorified, clarifies in various places in His speech: that whatever is not for His Noble Face (وجهه الكريم) is perished and vain, and that He will proceed to every deed they performed that was not for His Noble Face, and make it scattered dust (هباءً منثوراً), nullifying what they produced and invalidating what they used to do. And that nothing remains except His Noble Face. Thus, whatever is done for His Noble Face and produced in His Name is what remains and does not perish. Every matter, its share of persistence is only commensurate with the share Allah has in it. This is what is conveyed by what the two parties (الفريقان) narrated from the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم that He said: [Every matter of consequence (ذي بال) that is not begun with the Name of Allah is cut off (أبتر).] The *abtar* (الأبتر) is that which is cut off at the end. Therefore, it is most appropriate that the referent (متعلق) of the *bāʾ* (الباء) in the *Basmalah* (البسملة) is the beginning (ابتداء) with the meaning we mentioned. For the speech is begun with it inasmuch as it is an action among actions, so it necessarily possesses a unity (وحدة). And the unity of the speech is determined by the unity of its indication (مدلوله) and its meaning. Thus, it necessarily possesses a unified meaning, which is the meaning intended to be understood from the delivery of the speech, and the purpose (الغرض) achieved by it.\n\nAllah, the Glorified, has mentioned the purpose (الغرض المحصل) achieved by His speech, which is the entirety of the Qur’an, when He, the Exalted, said: **قَدْ جَاءَكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ يَهْدِي بِهِ اللَّهُ** المائدة ـ ١٦ (Certainly, there has come to you a light from Allah, and a manifest Book, by which Allah guides...) and other verses in which He conveyed that the ultimate goal (الغاية) of His Book and His speech is the guidance (هداية) of His servants. Thus, guidance, in its entirety (جملة), is what begins with بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم (In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful). He is Allah, to Whom is the return of the servants. He is the All-beneficent (الرحمن), clarifying for His servants the path of His general mercy (الرحمة العامة) encompassing the believer and the disbeliever, which contains their welfare in their existence and their life. And He is the All-merciful (الرحيم), clarifying for them the path of His specific mercy (الرحمة الخاصة) reserved for the believers, which is the felicity of their Hereafter and the meeting with their Lord. And He, the Exalted, has said: **وَرَحْمَتِي وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَسَأَكْتُبُهَا لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ** الاعراف ـ ١٥٦ (My mercy embraces all things. Soon I shall ordain it for those who are God-conscious...). This is concerning the entirety of the Qur’an.\n\nFurthermore, He, the Glorified, has frequently repeated the mention of the *sūrah* (السورة) in His speech, such as His saying, the Exalted: **فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِّثْلِهِ** يونس ـ ٣٨ (Bring a surah like it), and His saying: **فَأْتُوا بِعَشْرِ سُوَرٍ مِّثْلِهِ مُفْتَرَيَاتٍ** هود ـ ١٣ (Bring ten fabricated surahs like it), and His saying, the Exalted: **إِذَا أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ** التوبة ـ ٨٦ (When a surah is sent down), and His saying: **سُورَةٌ أَنزَلْنَاهَا وَفَرَضْنَاهَا** النور ـ ١ (A surah that We have sent down and enjoined). From this, it becomes clear to us: that each group among these groups of His speech (which He detailed piece by piece, and named each piece a *sūrah*) possesses a kind of unity of composition and completeness (وحدة التأليف والتمام) that is not found between parts of a single *sūrah* nor between one *sūrah* and another. From this, we know: that the purposes and goals (الأغراض والمقاصد) achieved by the *sūrahs* are distinct, and that each one is directed toward the clarification of a specific meaning and a definite purpose (غرض محصل) which the *sūrah* is not complete without its completion. Accordingly, the *Basmalah* at the beginning of every *sūrah* relates to the specific purpose of that *sūrah*.\n\nThus, the *Basmalah* in Sūrat al-Ḥamd (سورة الحمد) relates to the purpose of the *sūrah* and the meaning achieved by it. The purpose indicated by the sequence of speech in this *sūrah* is the praise (حمد) of Allah by manifesting servitude (العبودية) to Him, the Glorified, through the explicit declaration of worship (العبادة), seeking assistance (الاستعانة), and asking for guidance (سؤال الهداية). Therefore, it is speech spoken by Allah, the Glorified, on behalf of the servant, so that the servant may be disciplined (متأدباً) in the station of manifesting servitude with the etiquette (أدبه) Allah has taught him.\n\nAnd the manifestation of servitude by the servant is the deed (العمل) that the servant undertakes, and the matter of consequence (الأمر ذو البال) that he embarks upon. Thus, the beginning with the Name of Allah, the Glorified, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful, refers back to this. So the meaning is: "In Your Name, I manifest servitude to You."\n\nThus, the referent (متعلق) of the *bāʾ* (الباء) in the *Basmalah* of al-Ḥamd is the beginning (الابتداء), and what is intended by it is the completion of sincerity (الإخلاص) in the station of servitude through direct address (التخاطب). It is sometimes said that it is seeking assistance (الاستعانة), and there is no harm in that, but the beginning is more appropriate because the *sūrah* explicitly includes seeking assistance in His saying, the Exalted: **وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ** (and You [alone] do we ask for help.).\n\nAs for the Name (الاسم), it is the word (اللفظ) indicating the namesake (المسمى). It is derived either from *al-simah* (السمة), meaning the mark (العلامة), or from *al-sumuww* (السمو), meaning elevation (الرفعة). In any case, what is known of it linguistically (اللغة) and conventionally (العرف) is the indicative word, and this necessitates that it be other than the namesake. As for the Name (الاسم) in the sense of the Essence (الذات) taken with one of its attributes (أوصافه), it belongs to the concrete realities (الأعيان), not to the words (الألفاظ), and it is the namesake (مسمى) of the Name in the first sense. Just as the word *al-ʿĀlim* (العالم)—which is one of the Names of Allah, the Exalted—is a name that indicates its namesake, which is the Essence taken with the attribute of knowledge (العلم), it is itself a name with respect to the Essence, about which there is no information except through one of its attributes (أوصافه) and one of its descriptions (نعوته). The reason for this is that they found the word *al-ism* (الاسم) designated for the word that indicates the namesake. Then they found that the attributes taken in a manner that relates the Essence and indicates it are in the same position as the word called the Name (الاسم) in that they indicate external essences (ذوات خارجية). So they also called these attributes that indicate the essences *asmāʾ* (أسماء - names). This resulted in the Name being both a verbal matter (أمراً لفظياً) and a concrete matter (أمراً عينياً). Then they found that the indicator of the Essence closest to it is the Name in the second sense, which is derived through analysis (التحليل), and that the Name in the first sense only indicates the Essence through the mediation of the second sense. Therefore, they called the second sense a Name (إسماً), and the first sense the name of the Name (اسم الاسم). However, all of this is a matter resulting from theoretical analysis (التحليل النظري) and should not be imposed upon the language (اللغة). Linguistically, the Name is what we have mentioned.\n\nA dispute became widespread among the theologians (المتكلمين) in the early period of Islam regarding whether the Name (الاسم) is the same as the namesake (المسمى) or other than it, and the arguments concerning it were prolonged. However, this type of issue has become so clear today that it approaches the level of necessity (الضرورة), and it is not permissible to occupy oneself with it by mentioning what has been said and what is being said about it, or by focusing on invalidating what is false and establishing what is true concerning it. Therefore, turning away (الصفح) from that is more appropriate.\n\nAs for the majestic word (لفظ الجلالة), Allah (الله), its origin is *al-Ilāh* (الإله). The *hamzah* (الهمزة) was dropped due to frequent usage. *Ilāh* (إله) is derived from *alāha ar-rajul yaʾlahu* (أله الرجل يأله), meaning he worshipped (عبد), or from *alāha ar-rajul* (أله الرجل) or *waliha ar-rajul* (وله الرجل), meaning he was bewildered (تحير). It is a *fiʿāl* (فِعَال) with a *kasrah* on the *fāʾ*, meaning the object of the action (*mafʿūl*), like *kitāb* (كتاب) meaning *maktūb* (المكتوب - written). It was named *Ilāh* because He is worshipped (معبود) or because He is that in Whose Essence minds are bewildered (تحيرت). The apparent view is that it is a proper noun established by prevalence (علم بالغلبة). It was commonly used and circulated on tongues before the revelation of the Qur’an, known to the Arabs of the *Jāhiliyyah* (الجاهلي) era, as suggested by His saying, the Exalted: **وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ** بالزخرف ـ ٨٧ (And if you ask them, ‘Who created them?’ they will surely say, ‘Allah.’), and His saying, the Exalted: **فَقَالُوا هَٰذَا لِلَّهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ وَهَٰذَا لِشُرَكَائِنَا** بالأنعام ـ ١٣٦ (and they say, ‘This is for Allah’—so they claim—‘and this is for our partners.’).\n\nWhat indicates that it is a proper noun (علماً) is that it is described by all the Most Beautiful Names (الأسماء الحُسنى) and all His actions derived from those Names, without the reverse being true. Thus, one says: "Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful (ألله الرحمن الرحيم)," and one says: "Allah showed mercy (رحم الله)," "Allah knew (علم الله)," and "Allah provided sustenance (رزق الله)." But the majestic word (لفظ الجلالة) does not occur as an attribute (صفة) for any of them, nor is anything derived from it by which any of them is described.\n\nSince His existence, the Glorified—and He is the God (آله) of everything—guides to His being characterized by all attributes of perfection (الصفات الكمالية), all of them are implicitly indicated (مدلولاً عليها به بالالتزام) by it. Thus, what has been said is correct: that the majestic word (لفظ الجلالة) is a Name for the Necessary Existence (الواجب الوجود) Essence, Who encompasses all attributes of perfection. Otherwise, it is a proper noun established by prevalence (علم بالغلبة) in which no consideration (عناية) has operated other than what the root *ilāh* (إله) indicates.\n\n**As for the two attributes:** *al-Raḥmān* (الرحمن) and *al-Raḥīm* (الرحيم), both are derived from *al-raḥmah* (الرحمة - mercy), which is a passive attribute (وصف انفعالي) and a specific emotional effect (تأثر خاص) that touches the heart upon witnessing someone who lacks or needs what completes his affair, thereby prompting the person to complete his deficiency and remove his need. However, this meaning, according to analysis (التحليل), reverts to giving (الإعطاء) and bestowal (الإفاضة) to remove the need. It is in this sense that He, the Glorified, is characterized by mercy.\n\n*Al-Raḥmān* (الرحمن) is the pattern *faʿlān* (فعلان), a form of hyperbole (صيغة مبالغة) indicating abundance (الكثرة). *Al-Raḥīm* (الرحيم) is the pattern *faʿīl* (فعيل), a descriptive adjective (صفة مشبهّة) indicating permanence and persistence (الثبات والبقاء). For this reason, *al-Raḥmān* is suited to indicate the abundant mercy bestowed upon the believer and the disbeliever, which is the general mercy (الرحمة العامة). It is frequently used in the Qur’an with this meaning. He, the Exalted, said: **الرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ** طه ـ ٥ (The All-beneficent settled on the Throne.), and He said: **قُلْ مَن كَانَ فِي الضَّلَالَةِ فَلْيَمْدُدْ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ مَدًّا** مريم ـ ٧٥ (Say, ‘As for him who is in error, the All-beneficent will prolong his term considerably.’), and so on. For this reason also, *al-Raḥīm* is suited to indicate the perpetual blessing (النِعمَةِ الدائمة) and the constant, enduring mercy (الرَّحمة الثَّابتَة الباقية) that is bestowed upon the believer, as He, the Exalted, said: **وَكَانَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَحِيمًا** الأحزاب ـ ٤٣ (and He is All-merciful to the believers.), and He, the Exalted, said: **إِنَّهُ بِهِمْ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ** التوبة ـ ١١٧ (Indeed, He is kind to them and All-merciful.), and so on. Therefore, it has been said: *al-Raḥmān* is general, encompassing the believer and the disbeliever, while *al-Raḥīm* is specific to the believer.\n\n**And His saying, the Exalted:** الحمد لله (All praise belongs to Allah). Praise (*al-Ḥamd* - الحمد), according to what has been said, is commendation (الثناء) for voluntary beauty (الجميل الاختياري), while eulogy (*al-Madḥ* - المدح) is more general than it. One says: "I praised (حمدتُ) so-and-so or eulogized (مدحته) him for his generosity," but one says: "I eulogized the pearl for its purity," and one does not say: "I praised it for its purity." The *lām* (اللام) in it is for genus (الجنس) or for comprehensiveness (الاستغراق), and the outcome (المآل) here is the same.\n\nThis is because Allah, the Glorified, says: **ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ** غافر ـ ٦٢ (That is Allah, your Lord, the creator of all things.). Thus, He conveyed that everything that is a thing is created by Allah, the Glorified. And He said: **الَّذِي أَحْسَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَهُ** السجدة ـ ٧ (who perfected everything that He created.). Thus, He established beauty (الحسن) for everything created, by virtue of its being created by Him and attributed to Him. Therefore, beauty revolves around creation and vice versa. There is no creation except that it is good and beautiful (حسن جميل) through His perfection (إحسانه), and no beauty except that it is created by Him and attributed to Him. And He, the Exalted, has said: **هُوَ اللَّهُ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ** الزمر ـ ٤ (He is Allah, the One, the All-dominant.). And He said: **وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَيِّ الْقَيُّومِ** طه ـ ١١١ (and all faces shall be humbled before the Living, the Sustainer.). This informs us that He did not create what He created by the compulsion of a compeller (قهر قاهر), nor did He do what He did by the coercion of a coercer (اجبار من مجبر), but rather He created it out of knowledge and choice (علم واختيار). Thus, there is nothing except that it is a beautiful, voluntary action (فعل جميل اختياري) of His. This is from the perspective of action. As for the perspective of the Name, He, the Exalted, has said: **اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ لَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ** طه ـ ٨ (Allah—there is no god except Him—to Him belong the Best Names.). And He, the Exalted, said: **وَلِلَّهِ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَىٰ فَادْعُوهُ بِهَا وَذَرُوا الَّذِينَ يُلْحِدُونَ فِي أَسْمَائِهِ** الاعراف ـ ١٨٠ (To Allah belong the Best Names, so supplicate Him by them, and abandon those who commit sacrilege in His names.). Thus, He, the Exalted, is beautiful in His Names and beautiful in His actions, and every beautiful thing originates from Him.\n\nIt has thus become clear that He, the Exalted, is praised (محمود) for the beauty of His Names and praised for the beauty of His actions, and that there is no praise offered by a praiser for a praiseworthy matter except that it truly belongs to Allah, the Glorified, because the beauty (الجميل) to which the praise relates originates from Him, the Glorified. Therefore, the genus of praise (جنس الحمد) belongs to Allah, the Glorified, and all praise belongs to Him, the Glorified.\n\nFurthermore, it is apparent from the context and by the indication of the shift in address (الالتفات) found in His saying: **إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ** الآية (You [alone] do we worship...), that the *sūrah* is the speech of the servant, and that He, the Glorified, in this *sūrah*, instructs His servant in the praise of Himself and in the etiquette (ما ينبغي ان يتأدب به) that the servant should adopt when establishing himself in the station of servitude (مقام العبودية). This is supported by His saying: الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ (All praise belongs to Allah).\n\nThis is because praise (الحمد) is description (توصيف). He, the Glorified, has declared Himself far removed from the description of those of His servants who describe Him, where He said: **سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ إِلَّا عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ** الصافات ـ ١٦٠ (Clear is Allah of what they attribute [to Him], except the servants of Allah, the sincere ones.). The statement is absolute and unrestricted (مطلق غير مقيّد). Nothing has occurred in His, the Exalted\'s, speech that indicates the narration of praise from anyone other than what He narrated from a number of His sincere prophets. He, the Exalted, said in His address to Noah عليه\u200cالسلام: **فَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي نَجَّانَا مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ** المؤمنون ـ ٢٨ (Say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah, who delivered us from the wrongdoing lot.’). And He, the Exalted, said, narrating from Abraham عليه\u200cالسلام: **الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي وَهَبَ لِي عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ** ابراهيم ـ ٣٩ (All praise belongs to Allah, who gave me Ishmael and Isaac in my old age.). And He, the Exalted, said to His Prophet Muhammad صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم in several places in His speech: **وَقُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ** النمل ـ ٩٣ (and say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah.’). And He, the Exalted, said, narrating from David and Solomon عليهما السلام: **وَقَالَا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ** النمل ـ ١٥ (and they said, ‘All praise belongs to Allah.’). And also what He narrated from the inhabitants of Paradise (أهل الجنة), who are purified (المطهّرون) from the malice of hearts (غل الصدور), vain talk (لغو القول), and sinfulness (التأثيم), such as His saying: **وَآخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ** يونس ـ ١٠ (and their concluding invocation is: ‘All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.’).\n\nAs for cases other than these, even though He, the Exalted, narrated praise from many of His creation, indeed from all of them, such as His saying, the Exalted: **وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ يُسَبِّحُونَ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّهِمْ** الشورى ـ ٥ (and the angels glorify the praise of their Lord), and His saying: **وَيُسَبِّحُ الرَّعْدُ بِحَمْدِهِ** الرعد ـ ١٣ (and the thunder glorifies His praise), and His saying: **وَإِن مِّن شَيْءٍ إِلَّا يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِ** الاسراء ـ ٤٤ (There is not a thing but celebrates His praise), yet He, the Glorified, coupled the praise (الحمد) in all of them with glorification (*tasbīḥ* - التسبيح). Rather, He made glorification the primary element in the narration and coupled praise with it. This is because others besides Him, the Exalted, do not encompass the beauty and perfection of His actions, just as they do not encompass the beauty of His attributes and Names, from which the beauty of actions derives. He, the Exalted, said: **وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا** طه ١١٠ (and they do not comprehend Him in [their] knowledge.). Thus, whatever they describe Him with, they have encompassed it, and it becomes limited by their limits and measured by the extent of their attainment of it. Therefore, the commendation (ثناء) they offer is not sound unless they first declare Him far removed and glorify Him (ينزهوه ويسبّحوه) from what they have limited and measured by their understandings. He, the Exalted, said: **إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ** النحل ـ ٧٤ (Indeed, Allah knows and you do not know.). As for the sincere ones (المخلصون) among His servants, the Exalted, He has made their praise His praise and their description His description, since He made them sincere (مخلصين) to Him. It has thus become clear that the etiquette of servitude (أدب العبودية) requires the servant to praise his Lord with what He has praised Himself, and not to exceed that, as in the *ḥadīth* narrated by the two parties (الفريقان) from the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم: [I cannot enumerate commendation upon You; You are as You have commended Yourself.] Therefore, His saying at the beginning of this *sūrah*, الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ (All praise belongs to Allah), is a discipline (تأديب) with the etiquette of servitude, which the servant would not have been able to say had Allah, the Exalted, not said it on his behalf and as instruction regarding what should be commended.\n\n**And His saying, the Exalted:** رب العالمين الرحمن الرحيم مالك يوم الدين (Lord of all the worlds, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful, Master of the Day of Retribution) (The majority read *Malik Yawm ad-Dīn* [King of the Day of Retribution]). The Lord (*al-Rabb* - الرب) is the Owner (المالك) who manages (يدبّر) the affair of what He owns (مملوكه). Thus, it contains the meaning of ownership (*al-milk* - الملك). The meaning of ownership (الملك)—which we have in the context of society—is a specific type of exclusivity (الاختصاص), which is a type of dependence (قيام) of a thing upon another thing that necessitates the validity of dispositions (التصرفات) concerning it. So, our saying, "That specific object (العين الفلانية) is our property (ملكنا)," means: that it has a type of dependence and exclusivity to us, with which our dispositions concerning it are valid. Were it not for that, those dispositions would not be valid. In society, this is a conventional, stipulated meaning (معنى وضعيّ اعتباريّ) that is not real (غير حقيقي). It is derived from another real meaning which we also call ownership (*milk*), which is the manner in which the parts of our existence and our faculties (قوانا) depend upon us. For we have sight, hearing, a hand, and a foot, and the meaning of this ownership is that in their existence, they subsist by our existence, not independent of us, but rather independent by our independence, and we may dispose of them however we wish. This is the real ownership (الملك الحقيقي).\n\nWhat can truly be attributed to Him, the Exalted, is the reality of ownership (حقيقة الملك), not the stipulated ownership (الملك الاعتباري) which is invalidated by the invalidation of stipulation and convention. It is known that real ownership is inseparable from management (التدبير), for if a thing is dependent on something else for its existence, and is not independent of it in its existence, it will not be independent of it in the effects of its existence. Thus, He, the Exalted, is the Lord (رب) of everything besides Him, because the Lord is the Owner (المالك) and the Manager (المدبّر), and He, the Exalted, is indeed so.\n\n**As for *al-ʿĀlamīn* (العالمين):** It is the plural of *al-ʿālam* (العالم) with a *fatḥah* on the *lām*, meaning that by which something is known (ما يعلم به), like *al-qālib* (القالب), *al-khātam* (الخاتم), and *al-ṭābiʿ* (الطابع), meaning that by which something is molded, sealed, or stamped. It is applied to all existing things, and to every type composed of individuals and parts, such as the world of inanimate objects (عالم الجماد), the world of plants (عالم النبات), the world of animals (عالم الحيوان), and the world of humans (عالم الانسان), and also to every class composed of individuals, such as the world of the Arabs (عالم العرب) and the world of the non-Arabs (عالم العجم). This meaning is the most appropriate given the sequence of these Beautiful Names until it concludes with His saying, *Mālik Yawm ad-Dīn* (مالك يوم الدين - Master of the Day of Retribution), provided that the Retribution (*al-Dīn* - الدين), which is the recompense on the Day of Resurrection, is specific to humans, or to humans and jinn. In this case, the intended meaning of *al-ʿĀlamīn* would be the worlds of humans and jinn and their communities. This is supported by the occurrence of this word with this specific connotation in the Qur’an, such as His saying, the Exalted: **وَاصْطَفَاكِ عَلَىٰ نِسَاءِ الْعَالَمِينَ** آل عمران ـ ٤٢ (and chose you over all the women of the world.), and His saying, the Exalted: **لِيَكُونَ لِلْعَالَمِينَ نَذِيرًا** فرقان ـ ١ (that he may be a warner to all the worlds.), and His saying, the Exalted: **أَتَأْتُونَ الْفَاحِشَةَ مَا سَبَقَكُم بِهَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّنَ الْعَالَمِينَ** الاعراف ـ ٨٠ (Do you commit an indecency which no one in the world has committed before you?).\n\n**As for *Mālik Yawm ad-Dīn* (مالك يوم الدين):** You have already learned the meaning of *al-Mālik* (المالك - Owner/Master), which is derived from *al-milk* (الملك - ownership) with a *kasrah* on the *mīm*. As for *al-Malik* (الملك - King), which is derived from *al-mulk* (الملك - sovereignty) with a *ḍammah* on the *mīm*, he is the one who possesses the national system (النظام القومي) and its management, but not the physical object (العين). In other words, he possesses the command (الأمر) and the rule (الحكم) over them.\n\nVarious aspects of support have been mentioned for each of the two readings, *Malik* (ملك) and *Mālik* (مالك), although both meanings of sovereignty (السلطنة) are established concerning Him, the Exalted. What is known linguistically and conventionally is that *al-Malik* (الملك) with a *ḍammah* on the *mīm* is attributed to time. One says: "The King (*Malik*) of such-and-such era," and one does not say "The Owner (*Mālik*) of such-and-such era" except by a remote consideration. He, the Exalted, has said: مَلك يوم الدين (King of the Day of Retribution), thus attributing it to the Day. And He also said: **لِّمَنِ الْمُلْكُ الْيَوْمَ لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ** غافر ـ ١٦ (‘Whose is the sovereignty today?’ ‘It belongs to Allah, the One, the All-dominant!’).\n\n## (Narrative Discussion)\n\nIn *al-Uyun* and *al-Maʿānī*, narrated from Imam al-Rida عليه\u200cالسلام regarding the meaning of His saying: بسم الله (In the Name of Allah). He عليه\u200cالسلام said: "It means I mark my soul (أسمُ نفسي) with one of the marks (سمات) of Allah, which is worship (العبادة)." He was asked: "What is the mark (السمة)?" He replied: "The sign (العلامة)."\n\n**I say:** This meaning is as if generated from the meaning we pointed to regarding the *bāʾ* (الباء) being for the beginning (الابتداء). For if the servant marks his worship with the Name of Allah, it necessarily follows that he marks his soul, to which he attributes the worship, with one of His marks.\n\nIn *al-Tahdhīb*, narrated from Imam al-Sadiq عليه\u200cالسلام, and in *al-Uyun* and *Tafsīr al-Ayyāshī*, narrated from Imam al-Rida عليه\u200cالسلام: that it [the *Basmalah*] is closer to the Greatest Name of Allah (اسم الله الاعظم) than the pupil of the eye is to its white part.\n\n**I say:** The meaning of this narration will come later in the discussion concerning the Greatest Name (الاسم الاعظم).\n\nIn *al-Uyun*, narrated from the Commander of the Faithful عليه\u200cالسلام: that it [the *Basmalah*] is part of *al-Fātiḥah* (الفاتحة), and that the Messenger of Allah صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم used to recite it and count it as a verse from it, and say: "The Opening of the Book (فاتحة الكتاب) is the Seven Oft-Repeated (السبع المثاني)."\n\n**I say:** A similar meaning has been narrated through the channels of the People of the Sunnah and the Community (أهل السنة والجماعة). Thus, al-Dāraquṭnī narrated from Abū Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم said: "If you recite *al-Ḥamd* (الحمد), then recite بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم (In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful), for it is the Mother of the Qur’an (امّ القرآن) and the Seven Oft-Repeated (السبع المثاني), and بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم is one of its verses."\n\nIn *al-Khiṣāl*, narrated from Imam al-Sadiq عليه\u200cالسلام, he said: "What is wrong with them? May Allah fight them! They deliberately targeted the greatest verse in the Book of Allah and claimed that it is an innovation (بدعة) if they manifest it."\n\nAnd from Imam al-Baqir عليه\u200cالسلام: "They stole the most noble verse in the Book of Allah: بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم. And it is necessary to pronounce it when commencing every matter, great or small, so that it may be blessed (ليبارك فيه)."\n\n**I say:** The narrations from the Imams of the Household (أئمة أهل البيت) concerning this meaning are numerous, and they all indicate that the *Basmalah* is a part of every *sūrah* except Sūrat al-Barāʾah (سورة البراءة). There are also narrations among the People of the Sunnah and the Community that indicate this.\n\nIn *Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim*, narrated from Anas, the Messenger of Allah صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم said: "A *sūrah* was just now (آنفاً) revealed to me," and He recited: بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم.\n\nAnd from Abū Dāwūd, narrated from Ibn ʿAbbās (and they authenticated its chain of transmission): He said: The Messenger of Allah صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم did not know the separation of the *sūrah* (فصل السورة)—and in one narration, the conclusion of the *sūrah* (انقضاء السورة)—until بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم was revealed to Him.\n\n**I say:** This meaning has also been narrated through the channels of the *Khāṣṣah* (الخاصة - the Shi\'a) from Imam al-Baqir عليه\u200cالسلام.\n\nIn *al-Kāfī*, *al-Tawḥīd*, *al-Maʿānī*, and *Tafsīr al-Ayyāshī*, narrated from Imam al-Sadiq عليه\u200cالسلام in a *ḥadīth*: "Allah is the God (إله) of everything, the All-beneficent (الرحمن) to all His creation, and the All-merciful (الرحيم) specifically to the believers."\n\nIt is narrated from Imam al-Sadiq عليه\u200cالسلام: "The All-beneficent (الرحمن) is a specific name with a general attribute, and the All-merciful (الرحيم) is a general name with a specific attribute."\n\n**I say:** The reason for the generality of *al-Raḥmān* (الرحمن) encompassing the believer and the disbeliever, and the specificity of *al-Raḥīm* (الرحيم) to the believer, has become clear from what preceded. As for *al-Raḥmān* being a specific name with a general attribute, and *al-Raḥīm* being a general name with a specific attribute, it is as if he means by this that *al-Raḥmān* is specific to this world (الدنيا) and encompasses the disbeliever and the believer, while *al-Raḥīm* is general to this world and the Hereafter (الآخرة) and is specific to the believers. In other words: *al-Raḥmān* is specific to the existential bestowal (الإفاضة التكوينية) that encompasses the believer and the disbeliever, while *al-Raḥīm* encompasses both existence (التكوين) and legislation (التشريع), the door of which is the door of guidance and felicity (الهداية والسعادة), and is specific to the believers because permanence and persistence (الثبات والبقاء) are specific to the blessings bestowed upon them, and the ultimate outcome (العاقبة) is for godwariness (التقوى).\n\nIn *Kashf al-Ghummah*, narrated from Imam al-Sadiq عليه\u200cالسلام, he said: His father عليه\u200cالسلام lost a mule (بغلة), and he said: "If Allah returns it to me, I shall praise Him with praises that satisfy Him." It was not long before it was brought to him with its saddle and bridle. When he settled down and gathered his clothes to himself, he raised his head to the sky and said: الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ (All praise belongs to Allah), and did not add anything. Then he said: "I have left nothing and spared nothing; I have rendered all types of praises (أنواع المحامد) to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. There is no praise except that it is included in it."\n\nI say: And in *al-Uyun*, narrated from Ali عليه\u200cالسلام, he was asked about its interpretation, and he said: "It is that Allah introduced His servants to some of His blessings upon them in general terms (جملاً), since they are unable to know all of them in detail because they are too numerous to be counted or known. So He said: \'Say: All praise belongs to Allah for what He has bestowed upon us.\'"\n\n**I say:** He عليه\u200cالسلام is referring to what preceded: that the praise originates from the servant, and Allah only mentioned it by proxy (بالنيابة) as a means of discipline and instruction.\n\n## (Philosophical Discussion)\n\nThe rational proofs (البراهين العقلية) establish that the independence (استقلال) of the effect (المعلول) and every aspect of its affairs is only through the cause (العلة), and that every perfection (كمال) it possesses is from the shadows of the existence of its cause. If beauty and comeliness (الحسن والجمال) have a reality in existence, then their perfection and independence belong to the Necessary Existence (الواجب) Himself, because He is the Cause (العلة) to Whom all causes terminate. Commendation (الثناء) and praise (الحمد) are the manifestation by one existing thing of the perfection of another existing thing, which is necessarily its cause. Since all perfection terminates in Him, the Exalted, the reality of all commendation and praise returns and terminates in Him, the Exalted. Thus, الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ (All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the worlds).\n\n**His saying, the Exalted:** إياك نعبد وإياك نستعين الآية (You [alone] do we worship, and You [alone] do we ask for help). The servant (*al-ʿabd* - العبد) is the owned one (المملوك), whether human or any conscious being, by abstracting the meaning, as conveyed by His saying, the Exalted: **إِن كُلُّ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ إِلَّا آتِي الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَبْدًا** مريم ـ ٩٣ (There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to the All-beneficent as a servant.). Worship (*al-ʿibādah* - العبادة) is derived from it, and its derivations or the meanings used for it may vary due to the difference in contexts. What al-Jawharī mentioned in *al-Ṣiḥāḥ*—that the origin of servitude (*al-ʿubūdiyyah* - العبودية) is submission (الخضوع)—is a case of taking the necessary implication of the meaning. Otherwise, submission (*al-khuḍūʿ*) is transitive with the particle *lām* (اللام), while worship (*al-ʿibādah*) is transitive by itself.\n\nIn summary, it is as if worship (العبادة) is the servant establishing himself in the station of being owned (المملوكية) by his Lord. For this reason, worship is incompatible with arrogance (الاستكبار) but not incompatible with association (الاشتراك). It is permissible for more than one person to share in the ownership of a slave (رقبة) or in the worship of a servant. He, the Exalted, said: **إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِي سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَاخِرِينَ** غافر ـ ٦٠ (Indeed, those who are disdainful of My worship will enter hell in utter humiliation.). And He, the Exalted, said: **وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا** الكهف ـ ١١٠ (and not associate anyone with the worship of his Lord.’). Thus, He considered association (*shirk* - الاشراك) possible, and therefore He forbade it. Prohibition is only possible concerning something possible and within capability (مقدور), unlike arrogance concerning worship, which is incompatible with it.\n\nServitude (العبودية) is only sound between servants and their masters concerning what the masters own of them. As for aspects of the servant\'s existence that ownership does not relate to, such as his being the son of so-and-so or his height, no worship or servitude relates to them. However, Allah, the Glorified, in His ownership of His servants, is contrary to this description. Neither is His ownership tainted by the ownership of anyone besides Him, nor is the servant fragmented in his relation to Him, the Exalted, such that one part of him is owned and another part is not owned, nor is one disposition concerning him permissible and another disposition impermissible. This is unlike the servants among us, where one part of them is owned—which is their voluntary actions (افعالهم الاختيارية)—and another part is not owned—which is their involuntary attributes (الاوصاف الاضطرارية). And some dispositions concerning them are permissible, such as benefiting from their action, and some are impermissible, such as killing them without a crime, for example. Thus, He, the Exalted, is the Owner (مالك) absolutely, without condition or restriction, and everything besides Him is owned absolutely, without condition or restriction. Therefore, there is exclusivity (حصر) from two directions: the Lord is confined to ownership (المالكية), and the servant is confined to servitude (العبودية). This is what is indicated by His saying: إياك نعبد (You [alone] do we worship), where the object (المفعول) is placed first and the worship is left absolute (اطلقت).\n\nFurthermore, since the owned thing (الملك) subsists in its existence (متقوم الوجود) by its owner, as you learned from what preceded, it cannot be a veil (حاجباً) from its owner, nor can it veil him. For if you look at Zayd\'s house, if you look at it merely as a house, you can be heedless of Zayd. But if you look at it inasmuch as it is Zayd\'s property, you cannot be heedless of its owner, who is Zayd.\n\nBut you have learned that everything besides Him, the Exalted, possesses only the state of being owned (المملوكية), and this is its reality. Therefore, nothing of it truly veils Him, the Exalted, nor can looking at it coexist with heedlessness of Him, the Exalted. Thus, absolute Presence (الحضور المطلق) belongs to Him, the Exalted. He, the Glorified, said: **أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِ بِرَبِّكَ أَنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ فِي مِرْيَةٍ مِّن لِّقَاءِ رَبِّهِمْ أَلَا إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّحِيطٌ** حم السجدة ـ ٥٤ (Is it not enough for your Lord that He is witness to all things? Look! They are indeed in doubt about the encounter with their Lord. Look! He indeed comprehends all things.). If this is the case, then the right of His worship, the Exalted, is that it should proceed from presence (حضور) on both sides.\n\nAs for the side of the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, it is that He be worshipped with the worship of a present object of worship (معبودٍ حاضر), which necessitates the shift in address (الالتفات)—taken in His saying, the Exalted, إياك نعبد (You [alone] do we worship)—from the third person (الغيبة) to the second person (الحضور).\n\nAs for the side of the servant, it is that his worship be the worship of a present servant (عبد حاضر), without him being absent (يغيب) in his worship, such that his worship is merely a form without meaning, and a body without a soul. Or that he becomes fragmented (يتبعض) by occupying himself with his Lord and with others, either outwardly and inwardly, like the idolaters (الوثنيين) in their worship of Allah and their idols simultaneously, or inwardly only, like one who occupies himself in his worship with others besides Him, the Exalted, in the manner of goals and objectives. For instance, if he worships Allah while his concern (همَّه) is with something else, or if he worships Allah out of desire for Paradise or fear of the Fire, all of that is association (*shirk*) in worship, which has been forbidden. He, the Exalted, said: **فَاعْبُدِ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ** الزمر ـ ٢ (So worship Allah, dedicating your religion to Him.), and He, the Exalted, said: **أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ** الزمر ـ ٣ (Look! Exclusive allegiance is due to Allah. As for those who take guardians besides Him, [say,] ‘We do not worship them except that they may bring us nearer to Allah.’ Allah will judge between them concerning that about which they differ.).\n\nWorship (العبادة) is only true worship if it proceeds from sincerity (خلوص) on the part of the servant, which is the presence (الحضور) we mentioned. It has become clear that this is only achieved if he does not occupy himself with others besides Him, the Exalted, in his deed, thereby granting them partnership (الشركة) with Allah, the Glorified, in his worship; and if his heart is not attached in his worship to hope or fear that constitutes the ultimate goal (الغاية) of his worship, such as Paradise or the Fire, in which case his worship would be for them and not for the Face of Allah (لوجه الله); and if he does not occupy himself with his own self, which would be contrary to the station of servitude (مقام العبودية) that is incompatible with selfhood (*al-aniyyah* - الإنيّة) and arrogance (الاستكبار). It is as if the use of the first-person plural form (لفظ المتكلم مع الغير) is an allusion (إيماء) to this subtle point (النكتة), for it involves the humbling of the self (هضماً للنفس) by negating its individual determination (تعينها) and its singularity (شخوصها وحدها), which implies a kind of selfhood and independence. This is contrary to including it within the community (الجماعة) and mixing it with the common people (سواد الناس), for that involves effacing the determination and obliterating the trace, thereby securing against that [selfhood].\n\nFrom all of this, it has become clear: that the manifestation of servitude by His saying: إياك نعبد (You [alone] do we worship) does not contain any deficiency in terms of meaning or sincerity, except for what is in His saying إياك نعبد (You [alone] do we worship) regarding the servant attributing worship to himself, which implicitly entails the claim of independence (الاستقلال) in existence, power, and will, despite the fact that he is owned (مملوك) and the owned one owns nothing. It is as if He remedied this by His saying, the Exalted, وإياك نستعين (and You [alone] do we ask for help), meaning: we only attribute worship to ourselves and claim it for ourselves *with* seeking assistance from You, not being independent in that or claiming it without You. Thus, His saying: إياك نعبد وإياك نستعين (You [alone] do we worship, and You [alone] do we ask for help) is for the purpose of expressing a single meaning, which is worship proceeding from sincerity (إخلاص). It is possible that this is the reason for the unification of seeking assistance and worship in the rhetorical context, where it was said إياك نعبد وإياك نستعين (You [alone] do we worship, and You [alone] do we ask for help) instead of saying: "You [alone] do we worship, help us, and guide us to the straight path."\n\nAs for the change in context in His saying: اهدنا الصراط الآية (Guide us to the path...), the discussion concerning it will come, Allah willing.\n\nThus, the clarification provided regarding His saying: إياك نعبد وإياك نستعين الآية (You [alone] do we worship, and You [alone] do we ask for help) has made clear the reason for the shift in address (الالتفات) from the third person (الغيبة) to the second person (الحضور), the reason for the exclusivity (الحصر) conveyed by placing the object first (تقديم المفعول), the reason for the absolute nature (اطلاق) of His saying نعبد (we worship), the reason for choosing the first-person plural form (لفظ المتكلم مع الغير), the reason for following the first sentence with the second, and the reason for uniting the two sentences in the context. The exegetes (المفسرون) have mentioned other subtle points (نكات) surrounding this; whoever desires them should refer to their books. And He, Allah, the Glorified, is a creditor (غريم) whose debt is never fully paid (لا يقضى دينه).')

Sample Row: (1, '# Introduction\n\n## In the Name of Allah, the All-beneficent, the All-merciful\n\nPraise be to Allah, Who sent down the Criterion (الفرقان) upon His servant, that he may be a warner to all the worlds (للعالمين). And blessings be upon him whom He made a witness, a bearer of good news, and a warner, and a caller to Allah by His permission, and a luminous lamp (سراجاً منيراً); and upon his Household (آله) from whom He removed all impurity (الرجس), the People of the House (أهل البيت), and purified them with a thorough purification (تطهيراً).\n\n**Introduction:** In this introduction we briefly define the methodology (مسلك البحث) for investigating the meanings of the noble verses of the Qur\'an in this book.\n\nExegesis (التفسير)—which is the clarification of the meanings of the Qur\'anic verses and the uncovering of their aims (مقاصدها) and implications (مداليلها)—is one of the oldest scholarly preoccupations (الاشتغالات العلمية) known among Muslims. The history of this type of research and investigation, called *Tafsir*, began from the era of the revelation of the Qur\'an, as is evident from the saying of the Exalted and Sanctified: **كَمَا أَرْسَلْنَا فِيكُمْ رَسُولًا مِّنكُمْ يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِنَا وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ** (2:151) "Even as We sent to you an apostle from among yourselves, who recites to you Our signs, and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom."\n\nThe first stratum (الطبقة الاولى) of Muslim exegetes was a group of the Companions (الصحابة)—and by them we mean those other than Ali (عليه\u200cالسلام), for he and the Imams from his progeny have another story which we shall address—such as Ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar, Ubayy, and others, who devoted attention to this matter. The investigation at that time did not exceed the clarification of the verses related to their literary aspects (جهاتها الأدبية), the occasion of revelation (شأن النزول), a little bit of inference (الاستدلال) from one verse upon another, and likewise a little bit of exegesis through narrations (الروايات المأثورة) transmitted from the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم concerning stories, knowledge of the Beginning and the Return (المبدء والمعاد), and other topics.\n\nThe situation continued in this manner among the exegetes from the Successors (التابعين), such as Mujahid, Qatadah, Ibn Abi Layla, Al-Sha\'bi, Al-Suddi, and others, during the first two centuries of the Hijra. They did not add anything to the method of their predecessors, the exegetes among the Companions, except that they increased the use of exegesis by narrations (الروايات)—(among which were narrations inserted/fabricated (دسّها) by the Jews or others)—and they included these in stories and knowledge related to creation (الخلقة), such as the beginning of the heavens, the formation of the earth and the seas, Iram of the Pillars (إرم شدّاد), the lapses of the prophets (عثرات الأنبياء), the distortion of the Book (تحريف الكتاب), and other things of this nature. Some of this was already found in the transmitted exegesis and research from the Companions.\n\nThen, the prevalence of theological discourse (البحث الكلامي) after the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم during the time of the Caliphs necessitated a change, due to the mixing of Muslims with various groups (الفرق المختلفة) from the nations of the lands conquered by the Muslims, and with the scholars of diverse religions and schools of thought (المذاهب المتفرقة), on the one hand.\n\nAnd the translation of Greek philosophy into Arabic during the Umayyad Caliphate at the end of the first century of the Hijra, and then during the Abbasid era, and the spread of rational philosophical inquiry (البحث العقلي الفلسفي) among Muslim researchers, on a second hand.\n\nAnd the emergence of Sufism (التصوّف) concurrent with the spread of philosophical inquiry, and the inclination of people toward attaining religious knowledge through spiritual struggle (المجاهدة) and self-discipline (الرياضة النفسانية) rather than through verbal or rational investigation, on a third hand.\n\nAnd the persistence of a group of people, namely the People of Hadith (أهل الحديث), upon pure devotion (التعبد المحض) to the literal meanings (الظواهر) of religion, without any investigation except into the literary aspects of the wording, on a fourth hand.\n\nThe researchers in exegesis differed in their methodologies (مسالكهم) after the branching into schools of thought (الانشعاب في المذاهب) had taken its toll upon them. No common ground remained among them in opinion and view except the phrase لا إله إلا الله ومحمد رسول الله صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم. They differed regarding the meaning of the Names and Attributes (الأسماء والصفات), the Acts (الأفعال), the heavens and what is in them, the earth and what is upon it, Divine Decree and Destiny (القضاء والقدر), determinism and delegation (الجبر والتفويض), reward and punishment (الثواب والعقاب), death, the intermediate realm (البرزخ), the Resurrection (البعث), Paradise, and the Fire—in short, concerning everything that religious truths and knowledge touch, even slightly. Thus, they diverged in the path of investigating the meanings of the verses, and each one guarded the core tenets (متن) of the school of thought and method he had adopted.\n\nAs for the Traditionalists (المحدِّثون), they confined themselves to exegesis by narration (بالرواية) from the predecessors (السلف) among the Companions and the Successors. They proceeded and strove diligently in the path wherever the transmitted reports led them, and they stopped where nothing was transmitted and where the meaning did not appear with a clarity that obviated the need for investigation, taking hold of His, the Exalted’s, saying: **وَالرَّاسِخُونَ فِي الْعِلْمِ يَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِهِ كُلٌّ مِّنْ عِندِ رَبِّنَا** (3:7) "But those who are deeply rooted in knowledge say, ‘We believe in it. All of it is from our Lord.’" They erred in this, for Allah, the Glorified, did not invalidate the authority of reason (حجة العقل) in His Book; how could that be conceived when its authority is established only through it [reason]! Nor did He grant authority (حجيّة) to the sayings and views of the Companions and the Successors, despite their egregious differences. Nor did He call for sophistry (السفسطة) by accepting contradictory and conflicting statements. He only urged contemplation (التدبر) of His verses, thereby removing any apparent disagreement among them, and He made it guidance (هدىً), light (نوراً), and a clarification for everything (تبياناً لكلشيء). Why should the light seek illumination from a light other than itself? What concern is it of guidance to be guided by guidance other than itself? And how can that which is the clarification of everything be clarified by something other than itself?\n\nAs for the Theologians (المتكلمون), their differing doctrinal statements (الاقوال المذهبية) led them to proceed in exegesis according to what accorded with their schools of thought, by accepting what agreed and interpreting away (تأويل) what contradicted, according to what the doctrinal statement permitted.\n\nAlthough the choice of specific schools of thought and the adoption of particular methodologies and views may be caused by differences in scholarly perspectives or by something else, such as traditions and nationalistic biases (العصبيات القومية)—and this is not the place to delve into that—this path of investigation is more fittingly called application (تطبيقاً) rather than exegesis (تفسيراً).\n\nThere is a difference between the researcher investigating the meaning of a verse saying: "What does the Qur\'an say?" or saying: "What must we impose (نحمل عليه) upon the verse?" The first statement necessitates forgetting every theoretical matter during the investigation and relying upon what is not theoretical. The second necessitates establishing theories concerning the issue, accepting them, and building the investigation upon them. It is known that this manner of investigation into the discourse is not an investigation into its meaning in itself.\n\nAs for the Philosophers (الفلاسفة), what afflicted the Theologians among the exegetes also afflicted them: falling into the quagmire of application (ورطة التطبيق) and interpreting away (تأويل) the verses whose literal meanings contradicted the accepted premises (المسلمّات) in the various branches of philosophy in the general sense—meaning: mathematics, physics, metaphysics (الإلۤهيات), and practical wisdom (الحكمة العملية)—especially the Peripatetics (المشّائين). They interpreted away the verses concerning metaphysical realities (حقائق ما وراء الطبيعة), the verses of creation (الخلقة), the genesis of the heavens and the earth, the verses of the intermediate realm (البرزخ), and the verses of the Return (المعاد). They even resorted to interpretation (التأويل) for verses that did not conform to the hypotheses (الفرضيات) and established principles (الاصول الموضوعة) found in natural science: concerning the system of the universal and partial celestial spheres (الأفلاك), the arrangement of the elements, astronomical and elemental laws, and so forth, despite the fact that they themselves stipulated that these views are based on established principles that are neither self-evident (بينة) nor demonstrated (مبينة).\n\nAs for the Sufis (المتصوفة), due to their preoccupation with traversing the inner reality of creation (باطن الخلقة) and their attention to the internal signs (الآيات الأنفسية) rather than the manifest world and its external signs (الآيات الآفاقية), they confined their investigation to interpretation (التأويل) and rejected the literal revelation (التنزيل). This led to people daring to engage in interpretation, fabricating poetic phrases, and inferring everything from everything, until the matter devolved into interpreting verses using Abjad calculation (حساب الجمل), reducing words to *al-Zubur* and *al-Bayyinat*, and to luminous and dark letters (الحروف النورانية والظلمانية), and so forth.\n\nIt is clear that the Qur\'an was not revealed as guidance (هدى) specifically for the Sufis, nor are those addressed by it the masters of the science of numbers, talismans (الأوفاق), and letters, nor is its knowledge based on the foundation of Abjad calculation (حساب الجمل) which was established by the astrologers (أهل التنجيم) after the translation of astrology from Greek and other languages into Arabic.\n\nYes, narrations have been transmitted from the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم and the Imams of the Household (أئمه أهل البيت) عليهم السلام, such as their saying: "The Qur\'an has an outer meaning (ظهراً) and an inner meaning (بطناً), and its inner meaning has an inner meaning, up to seven inner meanings or up to seventy inner meanings," and so on.\n\nHowever, they (عليه السلام) considered the outer meaning (الظهر) just as they considered the inner meaning (البطن), and they attended to the matter of the literal revelation (التنزيل) just as they attended to the matter of interpretation (التأويل). We shall explain, God willing, in the beginning of Surah Al Imran, that the interpretation (التأويل) meant as the intended meaning that contradicts the literal meaning of the discourse is among the newly coined terms (اللغات المستحدثة) in the language of Muslims after the revelation of the Qur\'an and the spread of Islam, and that what the Qur\'an intends by the word *al-Ta\'wil* in the verses where it occurs is not of the category of meaning (المعنى) or concept (المفهوم).\n\nIn recent times, a new methodology (مسلك جديد) in exegesis has arisen. This is because a group of those who claim Islam (منتحلي الإسلام), following their immersion (توغلهم) in the natural sciences and similar fields based on sense and experience (الحس والتجربة), and the social sciences based on statistical experience (تجربة الاحصاء), inclined toward the doctrine of the Sensualists (الحسيّين) among earlier European philosophers, or toward the doctrine of the Primacy of Action (أصالة العمل)—(that perceptions have no value unless action results from them, to the extent determined by vital necessity, by the rule of compulsion/determinism).\n\nThey stated: Religious knowledge cannot contradict the path validated by the sciences, which is that: (There is no reality (أصالة) in existence except for matter and its sensible properties). Therefore, whatever the religion reports concerning existence whose literal meaning the sciences deny—such as the Throne (العرش), the Footstool (الكرسي), the Tablet (اللوح), and the Pen (القلم)—must be interpreted away (يؤّل تأويلا).\n\nAnd whatever it reports concerning existence that the sciences do not address, such as the realities of the Return (المعاد), must be explained according to material laws (بالقوانين المادية).\n\nAnd whatever the Divine Law (التشريع) relies upon—such as revelation (الوحي), the angel (الملك), the devil (الشيطان), prophethood (النبوة), apostleship (الرسالة), the Imamate (الامامة), and so forth—these are merely spiritual matters, and the spirit (الروح) is material and a type of material property. The Divine Law is a specific social genius (نبوغ خاص اجتماعي) that builds its laws upon sound ideas, with the goal of creating a righteous and advanced society (الاجتماع الصالح الراقي).\n\nThey stated: Narrations (الروايات), due to the admixture (الخليط) found within them, are not suitable for reliance, except for what conforms to the Book. As for the Book, its exegesis must not be based upon previous views and schools of thought that rely on rational inference (الاستدلال من طريق العقل), which science has invalidated by relying on sense and experience (الحس والتجربة). Rather, it is obligatory that the Qur\'an be independent in providing its own exegesis, except for what science has clarified.\n\nThis is a summary of what they stated or what is necessitated by what they stated, concerning the adherence to the path of sense and experience (الحس والتجربة). This led them to this method of exegesis. We shall not discuss here the scientific and philosophical principles (اصولهم) that they adopted as foundations and upon which they built their structure.\n\nRather, the discussion concerns the fact that the critique they leveled against the methodologies of the predecessors (السَلَف) among the exegetes—(that it is application and not exegesis)—applies exactly (وارد بعينه) to their own method of exegesis, even though they explicitly state that it is the true exegesis by which the Qur\'an is interpreted by the Qur\'an.\n\nIf they truly did not impose anything upon the Qur\'an in deriving the meanings of its verses, why do they take scientific views as accepted premises (مسلمة) that must not be transgressed? Thus, they have not added any correction to what the predecessors corrupted.\n\nIf you reflect upon all these transmitted methodologies (المسالك المنقولة) in exegesis, you will find that they all share a deficiency—and what a terrible deficiency it is—which is the imposition (تحميل) of the results produced by external scientific or philosophical investigations upon the implications (مداليل) of the verses. Exegesis is thereby transformed into application (تطبيقاً), and application is called exegesis. Consequently, Qur\'anic realities become metaphors (مجازاتٍ), and the literal revelation (تنزيل) of several verses becomes interpretations (تأويلات).\n\nThe necessary consequence of this (as we alluded to at the beginning of the discourse) is that the Qur\'an, which defines itself (as guidance for all the worlds (هدى للعالمين), a manifest light (نور مبين), and a clarification for everything (تبيان لكل شيء)), must be guided to by something else, illuminated by something else, and clarified by something else. What is this "something else" (الغير)! What is its status! By what means does it guide to the Qur\'an! And what is the reference and refuge (المرجع والملجاء) when there is disagreement concerning it! And indeed, disagreement has occurred and intensified.\n\nBe that as it may, this disagreement was not generated by a difference in view regarding the concept (مفهوم)—(the concept of the single word or the sentence according to the Arabic language and custom)—of the words or the verses. For it is a manifest Arabic discourse (كلام عربي مبين) whose understanding is not difficult for an Arab or anyone else who is knowledgeable of the language and the styles of Arabic discourse.\n\nThere is not a single verse among the verses of the Qur\'an (which are several thousand verses) that possesses obscurity (اغلاق) or complexity (تعقيد) in its concept such that the mind is bewildered in understanding its meaning. How could it be, when it is the most eloquent speech (افصح الكلام), and a condition of eloquence (الفصاحة) is the absence of obscurity and complexity in the discourse? Even the verses counted among the ambiguous verses (متشابه القرآن), such as the abrogated verses (المنسوخة) and others, are extremely clear in terms of concept. The ambiguity (التشابه) lies only in what is intended by them, and this is evident.\n\nRather, the entire disagreement lies in the external referent (المصداق) to which the verbal concepts—whether singular or compound—apply, and in the conceptual (التصوري) and assertive (التصديقي) implication.\n\nClarification of this: Familiarity and habit (الانس والعادة), as has been said, cause the material meanings of words, or what relates to matter, to immediately precede into our minds upon hearing them. This is because matter is what our bodies and our related faculties move within (يتقلب فيها) as long as we are in this worldly life (الحيوة الدنيوية). Thus, when we hear the words life, knowledge, power, hearing, sight, speech, will, pleasure, wrath, creation, and command, what immediately precedes into our minds are the material existences corresponding to their concepts.\n\nLikewise, when we hear the words heaven, earth, the Tablet (اللوح), the Pen (القلم), the Throne (العرش), the Footstool (الكرسي), the angel (الملك) and his wings, the devil (الشيطان) and his tribe, his cavalry, and his infantry (قبيله وخيله ورَجِله), and so forth, what immediately comes to our understanding are their natural referents (مصاديقها الطبيعية).\n\nAnd when we hear: "Allah created the world," or "He did such-and-such," or "He knew such-and-such," or "He willed or wills such-and-such," we restrict the action by time, based on what is customary for us (المعهود عندنا).\n\nAnd when we hear His saying, such as: **وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ** (50:35) "and with Us there is more." And His saying: **لَّاتَّخَذْنَاهُ مِن لَّدُنَّا** (21:17) "We would have surely taken it from Ourselves." And His saying: **وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ** (28:60) "and what is with Allah is better." And His saying: **إِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ** (2:28) "to Him you shall be brought back." We restrict the meaning of presence (الحضو) by place.\n\nAnd when we hear His saying, such as: **إِذَا أَرَدْنَا أَن نُّهْلِكَ قَرْيَةً أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا** (17:16) "When We desire to destroy a town, We command its affluent ones [to obey], but they commit transgression in it." Or His saying: **وَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ** (28:5) "We desired to confer favour." Or His saying: **يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ** (2:185) "Allah desires ease for you." We understand that all of them are a single type (سنخ واحد) of Will (الارادة), because the matter is such in what we possess, and so on by analogy.\n\nThis is our way concerning all utilized words, and we are entitled to this, for what necessitated us to establish words is only the social need for communication and comprehension (التفهيم والتفهّم). Man only became attached to society in order to achieve perfection through actions related to matter and its accessories. Thus, we established words as signs (علائم) for their referents (مسمياتها) from which we intend goals and purposes (غايات واغراضاً) that revert back to us.\n\nIt should have occurred to us to notice that material referents (المسميّات المادية) are subject to change and alteration (التغير والتبدل) according to the change in needs along the path of transformation and perfection (التحول والتكامل). Just as the lamp (السراج) that man first made was a vessel containing a wick (فتيلة) and some oil by which the wick was lit for illumination (للاستضائه) in the darkness, it continued to evolve until today it has reached the electric lamp, and not a single part remains of the components of the lamp first made, for which the word *al-Siraj* was designated.\n\nLikewise, the balance (الميزان) first made, and the balance made today, for weighing the weight of heat, for example.\n\nAnd the weapon (السلاح) adopted as a weapon on the first day, and the weapon made today, and so forth.\n\nThus, the referents have reached such a degree of change that they have lost all their previous components, both in essence and attribute, yet the name remains. This is only because what is intended in the naming is the *purpose* (غايته) of the thing, not its shape or form (شكله وصورته). As long as the purpose of weighing, illumination, or defense remains, the name of the balance (الميزان), the lamp (السراج), the weapon (السلاح), and others remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, we should have noticed that the criterion (المدار) for the truthfulness of the name is the inclusion of the external referent (المصداق) of the purpose and goal (الغاية والغرض), not the freezing of the word (جمود اللفظ) to a single form, for that is absolutely unattainable. However, habit and familiarity prevented us from realizing this. This is what led the imitators (المقلدة) among the People of Hadith, such as the Hashwiyyah (الحشوية) and the Anthropomorphists (المجسمة), to adhere rigidly to the literal meanings (ظواهر) of the verses in exegesis. In reality, this is not rigid adherence to the literal meanings, but rather rigid adherence to habit and familiarity in identifying the external referents (تشخيص المصاديق).\n\nHowever, among these literal meanings themselves are matters that clarify that relying upon habit and familiarity (الانس والعادة) in understanding the meanings of the verses confuses their aims (يشوّش المقاصد) and disrupts the matter of comprehension, such as His, the Exalted’s, saying: **لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ** (42:11) "Nothing is like Him." And His saying: **لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ الْأَبْصَارُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الْأَبْصَارَ وَهُوَ اللَّطِيفُ الْخَبِيرُ** (6:103) "The sights do not perceive Him, but He perceives the sights, and He is the All-subtle, the All-aware." And His saying: **سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ** (23:91) "Clear is Allah of what they attribute [to Him]!"\n\nThis is what prompted people not to confine themselves to the ordinary understanding and the mentally familiar external referent (المصداق المأنوس به الذهن) in comprehending the meanings of the verses. Just as the goal of avoiding error and attaining unknown results prompted man to cling to the skirt of scientific investigation, this allowed investigation to interfere in understanding the realities of the Qur\'an and identifying its sublime aims. This occurs in one of two ways: The first is that we investigate a certain issue addressed by the verse, scientifically, philosophically, or otherwise, until we arrive at the truth concerning that issue, and then we take the verse and impose that truth upon it. This is a method that theoretical investigation approves of, but the Qur\'an does not approve of it, as you have learned. The second is that we interpret the Qur\'an by the Qur\'an and clarify the meaning of a verse from its counterpart through the contemplation (التدبر) encouraged within the Qur\'an itself, and identifying the external referents (المصاديق) and recognizing them through the properties (الخواص) that the verses provide. As the Exalted said: **وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ تِبْيَانًا لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ** (16:89) "and We have sent down to you the Book as a clarification of everything." Far be it that the Qur\'an should be a clarification for everything (تبياناً لكلشي) yet not be a clarification for itself! And the Exalted said: **هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِّنَ الْهُدَىٰ وَالْفُرْقَانِ** (2:185) "guidance for mankind, and manifest proofs of the guidance and the Criterion." And the Exalted said: **وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكُمْ نُورًا مُّبِينًا** (4:174) "and We have sent down to you a manifest light." How can the Qur\'an be guidance, a manifest proof, a criterion, and a manifest light for people in all their needs, yet not suffice them in their need for it, which is the most intense need! And the Exalted said: **وَالَّذِينَ جَاهَدُوا فِينَا لَنَهْدِيَنَّهُمْ سُبُلَنَا** (29:69) "As for those who strive in Our way, We shall surely guide them to Our paths." And what striving (جهاد) is greater than exerting effort in understanding His Book! And what path is more guided to Him than the Qur\'an!\n\nThe verses concerning this meaning are numerous, and we shall exhaust our efforts in discussing them in the investigation of the clear (المحكم) and the ambiguous (المتشابه) verses at the beginning of Surah Al Imran.\n\nFurthermore, the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم—whom the Qur\'an taught and whom He made a teacher of His Book, as the Exalted says: **نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الْأَمِينُ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ** (26:193-194) "The Trustworthy Spirit brought it down upon your heart." And He says: **وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ** (16:44) "and We have sent down the Reminder to you, that you may clarify for the people that which has been sent down to them." And He says: **يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِهِ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ** (62:2) "who recites to them His signs and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and wisdom."—and his progeny (عترته) and his Household (أهل بيته)—(whom the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم established in this position in the *Hadith* agreed upon by both parties: [I am leaving among you the Two Weighty Things (الثقلين): as long as you hold fast to them, you will never go astray after me: the Book of Allah and my progeny, my Household. And indeed, they will never separate until they meet me at the Pool])—Allah, mighty is the Speaker (عز من قائل), confirmed their knowledge of the Qur\'an, where He said: **إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمُ الرِّجْسَ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ وَيُطَهِّرَكُمْ تَطْهِيرًا** (33:33) "Indeed Allah desires to repel all impurity from you, O People of the Household, and purify you with a thorough purification." And He said: **إِنَّهُ لَقُرْآنٌ كَرِيمٌ فِي كِتَابٍ مَّكْنُونٍ لَّا يَمَسُّهُ إِلَّا الْمُطَهَّرُونَ** (56:77-79) "This is indeed a noble Qur’an, in a preserved Book, none touches it except the purified." Their method of teaching and exegesis was precisely this method, according to the reports concerning exegesis that have reached us from them. We shall present what is feasible for us of what has been transmitted from the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم and the Imams of his Household in the context of the narrative discussions (ابحاث روائية) in this book. The diligent researcher will not find a single instance therein where the exegesis of a verse is aided by a theoretical rational argument (حجة نظرية عقلية) or a scientific hypothesis (فرضية علمية).\n\nThe Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم said: [When tribulations (الفتن) confuse you like pieces of dark night, then hold fast to the Qur\'an, for it is an intercessor whose intercession is accepted (شافع مشفع) and a truthful accuser (وما حل مصدق). Whoever places it in front of him, it leads him to Paradise, and whoever places it behind him, it drives him to the Fire. It is the guide (الدليل) that points to the best path. It is a book of detail (تفصيل), clarification (بيان), and attainment (تحصيل). It is the decisive word (الفصل), not jest (الهزل). It has an outer meaning (ظهر) and an inner meaning (بطن); its outer meaning is wisdom (حكمة) and its inner meaning is knowledge (علم). Its outer meaning is elegant (انيق) and its inner meaning is profound (عميق). It has sections (نجوم), and upon its sections are sections. Its wonders are countless, and its novelties are inexhaustible. In it are the lamps of guidance (مصابيح الهدى) and the beacon of wisdom (منار الحكمة), and a guide to the known for whoever recognizes fairness (النصفة). Let a man guard his sight, and let his gaze reach the description (الصفة); he will be saved from destruction (عطب) and freed from entanglement (نشب). For contemplation (التفكر) is the life of the heart of the insightful, just as the illuminated walks in the darkness by light. He achieves good deliverance and reduces hesitation.] And Ali عليه\u200cالسلام said (describing the Qur\'an, as found in *Nahj al-Balaghah*): [Some of it speaks about some of it, and some of it bears witness to some of it.]\n\nThis is the straight path (الطريق المستقيم) and the level road (الصراط السوي) that the teachers and guides of the Qur\'an, peace be upon them, followed.\n\nWe shall present, with the help of Allah, the Glorified, what is feasible for us of discourse concerning this method of investigating the noble verses within the context of commentaries (بيانات), in which we have avoided relying upon a theoretical philosophical argument (حجة نظرية فلسفية), a scientific hypothesis (فرضية علمية), or a gnostic unveiling (مكاشفة عرفانية).\n\nAnd we have been careful therein not to omit literary subtleties (الانكتة ادبية) required for understanding the Arabic style, or a self-evident or practical premise (مقدمة بديهية او عملية) about which understandings do not differ.\n\nThe discourse presented in these commentaries, based on this method of investigation, aims to exhaust the discussion concerning the following:\n\n(1) Knowledge related to the Names and Attributes of Allah, the Glorified (أسماء الله سبحانه وصفاته), such as life, knowledge, power, hearing, sight, unity, and others. As for the Essence (الذات), you will find that the Qur\'an considers it beyond clarification (غنياً عن البيان).\n\n(2) Knowledge related to His, the Exalted’s, Acts (افعاله تعالى), such as creation (الخلق), command (الامر), will (الإرادة), desire (المشية), guidance (الهداية), misguidance (الاضلال), Divine Decree and Destiny (القضاء والقدر), determinism and delegation (الجبر والتفويض), pleasure (الرضا), and wrath (السخط), and other miscellaneous acts.\n\n(3) Knowledge related to the intermediaries (الوسائط) situated between Him and man, such as the Veils (الحُجُب), the Tablet (اللوح), the Pen (القلم), the Throne (العرش), the Footstool (الكرسي), the Frequented House (البيت المعمور), the heaven and the earth, the angels (الملائكة), the devils (الشياطين), the jinn (الجن), and others.\n\n(4) Knowledge related to man before this world (الدنيا).\n\n(5) Knowledge related to man in this world, such as knowledge of the history of his species, knowledge of his soul (نفسه), knowledge of the principles of his society, and knowledge of prophethood (النبوة), apostleship (الرسالة), revelation (الوحي), inspiration (الالهام), the Book, the religion (الدين), and the Divine Law (الشريعة). Related to this are the stations of the prophets (مقامات الانبياء) derived from their narrated stories.\n\n(6) Knowledge related to man after this world, which is the intermediate realm (البرزخ) and the Return (المعاد).\n\n(7) Knowledge related to human ethics (الاخلاق الانسانية). Related to this are the stations of the saints (مقامات الأولياء) on the path of servitude (صراط العبودية), such as submission (الاسلام), faith (الايمان), excellence (الإحسان), humility (الإخبات), sincerity (الإخلاص), and others.\n\nAs for the verses of legal rulings (آيات الأحكام), we have avoided detailed clarification concerning them, as that reverts to jurisprudence (الفقه).\n\nThis method of investigation has resulted in the elimination of interpretation (التأويل)—in the sense of imposing a meaning that contradicts the literal sense—from among the verses. As for *al-Ta\'wil* in the sense that the Qur\'an affirms in various places in the verses, you will see that it is not of the category of meanings.\n\nThen, at the end of the commentaries (البيانات), we have placed miscellaneous narrative discussions (ابحاث روائية) in which we present what was feasible for us to include of the narrations transmitted from the Prophet صلى\u200cالله\u200cعليه\u200cوآله\u200cوسلم and the Imams of the Household (أئمة أهل البيت) سلام الله عليهم أجمعين, from both the general (العامة) and specific (الخاصة) sources. As for the narrations reported from the exegetes among the Companions and the Successors, due to the errors and contradictions found within them, they hold no authority (لا حجة فيها) for a Muslim.\n\nThe contemplative researcher (الباحث المتدبر) into the narrations transmitted from them عليهم السلام will discover that this modern method upon which the commentaries of this book are built is the oldest of the transmitted methods in exegesis, which was followed by its teachers, peace be upon them.\n\nThen we have included various discussions—philosophical, scientific, historical, social, and ethical—according to what was feasible for us to investigate. In every discussion, we have preferred to confine the discourse to the premises analogous (المقدمات المسانخة) to it, without transgressing the scope of the investigation.\n\nWe ask Allah, the Exalted, for correctness (السداد) and guidance (الرشاد), for He is the best Helper and Guide.\n\nThe one in need of Allah: Muhammad Husayn al-Tabatabai.')
